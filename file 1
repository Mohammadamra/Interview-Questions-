Interview Questions for Semiconductor Roles

This repository contains a curated list of common interview questions across CMOS, Digital Logic, Verilog, and Computer Organization & Architecture.

ðŸ”¹ Section 1: CMOS

Draw the cross section of a full functional inverter and mark down the parts.

Depending on the cross section you've drawn, mark the position in which parasitic diodes are formed.

Using CMOS, design a 3-input NAND gate.

State the need for an n-well when creating a PMOS.

Write down the steps (or masks) we use when designing any circuit using CMOS (Fabrication Steps).

ðŸ”¹ Section 2: Digital Logic

Design Mealy and Moore sequence detectors to detect the sequence 1011 (use any input you want for testing).

State the difference between Mealy and Moore state machines in your own words.

Design an 8:1 Multiplexer using only 2:1 Multiplexers.

Implement an AND gate using only NAND gates.

Explain setup time and hold time in your own words (use an example if needed).

ðŸ”¹ Section 3: Verilog

State the difference between blocking (=) and non-blocking (<=) assignments using an example.

State the difference between Synchronous and Asynchronous reset using Verilog code.

Explain the difference between always @(*) and always @(posedge clk).

What are synthesizable constructs vs non-synthesizable constructs?

Write a 2:4 Decoder in Verilog using a case statement.

ðŸ”¹ Section 4: Computer Organization and Architecture

What is the difference between CISC and RISC architectures?

Explain pipelining hazards (RAW, WAR, WAW, structural hazards).

What is cache memory? Explain direct-mapped, associative, and set-associative caches.

Difference between Harvard and Von Neumann architectures.

Difference between hardwired control and microprogrammed control.
